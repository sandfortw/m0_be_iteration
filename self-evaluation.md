# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
After doing it several times, I feel pretty good. I feel like I worked through my main bugs with it. 

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

Mostly productive struggle, though I had a persitant error message due to not having enough `end`'s. I worked through it by trying to reach out to a teammate, but solved it before he saw my message. 

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I don't need to adjust my calendar, but I should practice for typing speed. 

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

I'm too tired now to have questions! Google is answering any that pop up right now.
